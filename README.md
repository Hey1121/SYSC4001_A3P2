The TA_Body files must be compiled as TA_Body for the part 1 (no semaphores) and TA_Body_Semaphore for part 2 (with semaphores). The constructors can be compiled with any name. The constructors take a single argument, a positive integer. This argument is the number of TAs that the constructor will create and run. Part 1 contains several race conditions and will therefore act inconsistently, with more unstable behaviour if there are more TAs. Part 2 has been tested to function properly with up to 10 TAs, although any number above 5 will not signficantly change the speed or manner that the program runs.
